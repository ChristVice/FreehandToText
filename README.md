# üéì Senior Project: AI-Enhanced Freehand Assistant

This project is a cross-disciplinary application combining **C++** (for interactive UI) and **Python** (for AI processing) to create a **freehand drawing app** with smart AI capabilities. Users can draw naturally, and the system provides **real-time feedback**, **shape recognition**, or even **auto-enhanced artwork** using machine learning models.

## ‚ú® Features

### üñåÔ∏è Drawing Interface (C++ & SFML)
- Freehand drawing using mouse input
- Clean and smooth lines with `sf::VertexArray`
- Clear canvas with right-click
- Potential for adding UI tools like color picker, brush size

### üß† AI Integration (Python)
- Shape detection (e.g., circles, squares)
- Suggestions to enhance user sketches
- Style transfer or sketch cleanup using ML models (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
- Communication between C++ and Python via sockets or REST API

## üîç Project Goals

- **Bridge C++ and Python** for real-time interactive graphics + AI
- **Build an intuitive UI** using SFML in C++
- **Train or use an existing model** to analyze or enhance drawings
- **Deliver a polished, creative, and technical capstone project**
